    Normally the exact time when the build started is used to populate the wiki page. But this may not always be the
    desired case. For extra precaution, you may want to look at the wiki page with tasks one hour before the QA/PATCH
    Build. If that's the case, then use this option. <br/><br/> <b>Note: the value is in 'seconds'.</b> So if you want
    to take tasks that's 2 hour before the build started, then Delay time should be 2*60*60 = 7200.<br/><br/>Default
    value is 5 minutes.
